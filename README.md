# Python Mini Projects 

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects. Each project is designed to strengthen your understanding of core Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, randomization, file handling, and user input.

## Projects Included

### 1. Dice Game
- **File:** `project1.py`
- **Description:**  
  A fun dice game for 2â€“4 players. Players take turns rolling a dice until someone reaches a score of 50. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they score nothing for that round. Strategic choices and luck decide the winner.
- **Concepts Used:**  
  - Random number generation (`random.randint`)  
  - Loops and user input  
  - Lists to store player scores  
  - Conditional logic  
- **How to Run:**  
  ```bash
  python project1.py
  ```

### 2. Mad Libs Story Generator
- **File:** `project2.py`  
- **Supporting File:** `story.txt`  
- **Description:**  
  A story-based word game where the program loads a template story containing placeholders (like `<animal>`, `<place>`). The user fills in words, and the program replaces the placeholders to generate a unique, fun story.
- **Concepts Used:**  
  - File handling (`open`, `read`)  
  - String replacement  
  - Sets and dictionaries to track words  
  - User input  
- **How to Run:**  
  ```bash
  python project2.py
  ```

### 3. Math Quiz Game
- **File:** `project3.py`
- **Description:**  
  A simple arithmetic quiz that generates random math problems using addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The player must solve 10 problems, and the program times how long it takes. Wrong attempts are tracked until the correct answer is given.
- **Concepts Used:**  
  - Random problem generation  
  - Loops and conditionals  
  - Timers (`time` module)  
  - Evaluating expressions with `eval`  
- **How to Run:**  
  ```bash
  python project3.py
  ```
